# 🌙 Khatm Planner

This is a prototype for a smart, easy-to-use React app that helps groups organize and track their Quran completion journey together. I used it as a means to get comfortable with vite + react and javascript. Please feel free to use and share.  

## Features

- Automatically divides 603 pages of the Quran among your group members, not the last one since we will read it together.
- Names rotate automatically so everyone gets fresh pages to read
- See exactly which Surah and Ayah each person reads
- The participant list and cycle number are saved locally
